        "\n",
        "Prompt engineering is a burgeoning field aimed at crafting optimal prompts to effectively utilize language models for various tasks. This discipline aids in comprehending the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs) by employing different strategies to extract improved responses from foundational models, negating the need for costly and time-consuming retraining or adjustments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Distinct from fine-tuning, where a model's parameters are altered through training data to optimize performance, prompt engineering directs the pre-trained foundation model to yield more precise and relevant outputs. This result is achieved through well-crafted queries, presenting examples, breaking down questions into more straightforward steps, and employing logical reasoning.\n",
        "\n",
        "The concept of \"priming\" plays a central role in prompt engineering. In this method, we provide the model with context and a few examples of the desired outcome before receiving the actual input. This setup encourages the model to replicate the primed behavior. Users can fine-tune the model's understanding and adjust its responses to fit the conversation's context by engaging with the LLM using questions, statements, or instructions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Prompt engineering represents a significant advancement in using, developing, and comprehending language models, particularly more significant variants. It revolves around the innovative design of prompts and interactions to unlock new potentials in language technology, tackle its limitations, and glean more profound insights into its mechanisms. Through prompt engineering, we're equipped with methodologies and approaches to extend the capabilities and applications of language models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Prompt engineering emerges as the most efficient method for leveraging large language models' capabilities, refining how we engage and steer these advanced tools. This innovative field enhances the models' functionality, elevates safety standards, and deepens our comprehension of their operational framework. By integrating a variety of techniques for interaction and development, prompt engineering fosters the achievement of unprecedented milestones, such as enriching domain-specific knowledge without altering the underlying model parameters or resorting to fine-tuning. This approach emphasizes the significance of crafting superior prompts to yield higher-quality outcomes. Our discussion centers on the optimal practices for prompt engineering, mainly focusing on OpenAI models. You could apply these techniques to other models, such as those offered by Anthropic and AI21, as well as the Amazon Titan models, guiding users on maximizing their utility effectively.\n",

        "* **Context** External information to guide the model.\n",
