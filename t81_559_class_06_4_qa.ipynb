Documents\n","\n","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced technique designed to enhance the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by integrating external data into the response generation process. For RAG to be truly effective, it must operate over data that is not already present in the foundation model. This is crucial because the primary advantage of RAG lies in its ability to pull in specific, often up-to-date information that the LLM might not have been exposed to during its initial training.\n","\n","This feature makes RAG particularly valuable for corporate environments. Companies generate and store vast amounts of proprietary data, including internal documents, customer information, and detailed reports. This data is often unique to the organization and not part of the publicly available corpus that an LLM would be trained on. By using RAG, businesses can leverage their own data to obtain more precise and contextually relevant answers from their LLMs, thereby improving decision-making processes and operational efficiency.\n","\n","To illustrate the capabilities of RAG, we will utilize a sample dataset I created, containing synthetic data of employee biographies from five fictional companies. This dataset is crafted to demonstrate how RAG can effectively retrieve and utilize specific information that a foundation model would not inherently possess. By doing so, it provides a clear example of how RAG can be applied in a real-world corporate setting.\n","\n","Here is an example of such a generated biography:\n","\n","> Elena Martinez is a seasoned Robotics Engineer at FutureTech, a leading innovator in artificial intelligence and robotics based in Silicon Valley. With a Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from MIT and over a decade of experience, Elena has been pivotal in the development of autonomous robotic systems designed to enhance urban mobility and accessibility. Her groundbreaking work includes the creation of the first AI-powered robotic assistant that can seamlessly interact with urban environments to aid the elderly and disabled. A passionate advocate for women in STEM, Elena also leads FutureTech's outreach program, aiming to inspire the next generation of female engineers through workshops and mentorships. Her contributions have not only propelled FutureTech to new heights but have also set new standards in robotics applications for social good.\n","\n","\n","This biography showcases the type of detailed, company-specific information that RAG can retrieve and incorporate into its responses, enhancing the relevance and accuracy of the generated content.

For each URL, it fetches the content using the requests.get method and checks for any HTTP errors with response.raise_for_status().

These chunks are then used to create Document objects, each containing a portion of the text.
