efficiently extract and structure information from the outputs returned by large language models (LLMs). These output parsers play a crucial role in LangChain's architecture, typically forming integral components of what are known as LangChain chains. These chains are configurable sequences of operations that process and interact with model outputs to perform complex tasks. To facilitate the creation and management of these chains, LangChain introduces the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL).\n","\n","Next, we will delve into how LCEL enables the advanced creation and execution of LangChain chains, and subsequently explore how different output parsers can be utilized within these chains to achieve precise and actionable insights from LLM outputs.\n","\n","## LangChain Expression Language, or LCEL\n","\n","LangChain Expression Language, or [LCEL](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/), provides a declarative way to easily compose chains. From its inception, LCEL has supported transitioning prototypes to production without any code changes. This includes everything from simple \"prompt + LLM\" chains to highly complex chains that some users have successfully implemented with hundreds of steps in production environments. Here are several reasons why you might choose LCEL:\n","\n","* [First-class streaming support](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/streaming/): By building your chains with LCEL, you achieve the optimal time-to-first-token, which is the time elapsed until the first output chunk appears. In some instances, this means streaming tokens directly from an LLM to a streaming output parser, delivering parsed, incremental chunks of output at the same rate the LLM provider releases the raw tokens.\n","\n","* [Async support](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/interface/): Chains built with LCEL can use both synchronous APIs (for example, in your Jupyter notebook during prototyping) and asynchronous APIs (for example, in a LangServe server). This dual capability allows the same code to perform efficiently in both prototypes and production, handling many concurrent requests on the same server.\n","\n","* [Optimized parallel execution](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/primitives/parallel/): LCEL automatically executes parallelizable steps in your chains simultaneously, whether you are using synchronous or asynchronous interfaces, minimizing latency.\n","\n","* [Retries and fallbacks](https://python.langchain.com/docs/guides/productionization/fallbacks/): You can configure retries and fallbacks for any part of your LCEL chain, enhancing reliability at scale. We are also enhancing streaming support for retries and fallbacks to improve reliability without increasing latency.\n","\n","* [Access to intermediate results](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/interface/#async-stream-events-beta): For more complex chains, accessing intermediate results can be crucial. This feature allows end-users to see progress or helps developers debug the chain. Intermediate results are streamable and available on every LangServe server.\n","\n","* [Input and output schemas](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/interface/#input-schema): Every LCEL chain comes with Pydantic and JSONSchema schemas inferred from your chain's structure. These schemas are essential for validating inputs and outputs and are a core feature of LangServe.\n","\n","* [Seamless LangSmith tracing](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langsmith/): As chains grow in complexity, it's vital to trace each step. LCEL automatically logs all steps to LangSmith for enhanced observability and debuggability.\n","\n","* [Seamless LangServe deployment](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langserve/): Deploying a chain created with LCEL is straightforward using LangServe, facilitating seamless transitions from development to production."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"-Vds7BAWITTH","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1756219883539,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":8,"user":{"displayName":"Jeff Heaton","userId":"18292667475657506830"}}},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HMLrKTqgSRkM"},"source":["# Introduction to the StructuredOutputParser\n","\n","LangChain offers a variety of tools designed to help process and extract information from the output of large language models (LLMs).

Although the Pydantic/JSON parser provides a more robust and feature-rich option for handling complex data structures, the Structured Output Parser is an excellent choice for environments where computational resources are limited, or when using less powerful models. It offers a straightforward and efficient way to structure output without overwhelming the model or the system.\n","\n","We begin by creating a ResponseSchema for each value we wish to extract.
